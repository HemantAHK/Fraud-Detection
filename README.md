# Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

*What is Fraud Detection?*</br>
**Fraud Detection** is a set of activities undertaken to prevent money or property from being obtained through false pretenses. Fraud detection is applied to many industries such as banking or insurance.</br>

*what does machine learning do in fraud detection?*</br>
It uses complex algorithms that iterate over large data sets and analyze the patterns in data. The algorithm facilitates the machines to respond to different situations for which they have not been explicitly programmed.</br>

*From Where i get the Data?*</br>
It is a Data hosted on Kaggle Competation for a fraud detection challange. Here is the link for the full detailled view of the competation([IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection)).</br>

*What is the Objective of this repository?*</br>
To create a benchmark machine learning model to improve the efficacy of fraudulent transaction alerts for millions of people around the world, helping hundreds of thousands of businesses reduce their fraud loss and increase their revenue. And of course, you will save party people just like you the hassle of false positives.</br>

## Built With
* [SkLearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
